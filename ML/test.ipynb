      "\n",
      "* **Timing:** Apply fungicides as soon as symptoms appear on plants or as a preventive measure when conditions favor disease development (e.g., high humidity and frequent rainfall).\n",
      "* **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the entire plant surface, including the undersides of leaves.\n",
      "* **Frequency:** Repeat applications according to the manufacturer's instructions or as needed, depending on weather conditions and disease pressure.\n",
      "* **Tank Mixing:** Combining different fungicides with different modes of action can help reduce the risk of resistance development.\n",

      "**Additional Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Water plants carefully to avoid wetting the foliage, as this can promote disease development.\n",
