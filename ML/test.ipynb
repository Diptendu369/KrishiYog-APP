      "* **Sanitation:** Remove infected plant material from the field and destroy it. Do not compost infected plants.\n",
      "* **Spacing:** Plant potatoes at an appropriate spacing to allow for good air circulation and reduce the spread of disease.\n",
      "* **Avoid overhead watering:** Water potatoes at the base of the plant to minimize foliar wetness that can promote disease development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chemical Control Measures:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fungicides:** Apply fungicides containing fixed copper, mancozeb, or chlorothalonil according to the manufacturer's instructions. Begin applications when disease symptoms first appear and repeat every 7-10 days as needed.\n",
      "* **Biocontrols:** Use biological control agents such as Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma harzianum to suppress early blight.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Combine cultural and chemical control practices for effective management of early blight.\n",

      "* Consult with an agricultural extension agent or plant pathologist for specific recommendations based on local conditions and disease severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Inspect seed potatoes:** Before planting, inspect seed potatoes for signs of early blight. Reject any infected potatoes.\n",
      "* **Mulch around plants:** Apply organic mulch around potato plants to conserve moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds that can harbor the disease.\n",
      "* **Provide adequate nitrogen:** Ensure potatoes receive adequate nitrogen fertilizer, as this can help plants tolerate early blight infection.\n",
      "* **Harvest potatoes promptly:** Harvest potatoes when they are mature and before the disease becomes severe.\n"
